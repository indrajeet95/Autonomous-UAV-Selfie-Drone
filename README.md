# Autonomous-UAV-Selfie-Drone
Selfie Drone which can recoginize human faces and effectively click the perfect selfie.

Utilized OPENCV's pre trained classifiers - Haar and LBP Cascade Classifier for face detection. 
Modified the Selfie Routine which works through the dataset of images, records the time taken for face detection and sorts the pictures based on if the face is detected or not.
